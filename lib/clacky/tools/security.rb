module Clacky
  module Tools
    # Pre-execution safety layer for shell-style commands.
    #
    # Design principle: protect against the handful of commands that are
    # irreversibly destructive or can compromise the host. Everything else
    # is the user's (or agent's) business. Over-protection burns tool-call
    # rounds and forces awkward work-arounds (e.g. the infamous "cp ~/.clacky
    # /xxx ./ ... Blocked: outside project directory" dance).
    #
    # Responsibilities (applied to the `command` string BEFORE it is handed
    # to a shell / PTY for execution):
    #
    #   1. Block hard-dangerous commands:       sudo, pkill clacky, eval, exec,
    #                                           `...`, | sh, | bash,
    #                                           redirect to /etc /usr /bin.
    #   2. Rewrite `curl ... | bash` → save     script to a file for manual
    #                                           review instead of exec.
    #   3. Protect credential/secret files:     .env, .ssh/, .aws/ — block
    #                                           writes to these only. Other
    #                                           "project" files (Gemfile,
    #                                           README.md, package.json, …)
    #                                           are NOT protected — editing
    #                                           them is a normal dev task.
    #
    # Note on `rm`:
    #   `rm` is NOT rewritten here — it's intercepted at runtime by a shell
    #   function installed in each PTY session (see Terminal::SAFE_RM_BASH
    #   and Terminal#install_marker). This lets the shell's own parser
    #   handle heredocs / multi-line / globs / variables correctly. A
    #   static Ruby-side rewrite cannot — it would mis-parse heredoc
    #   bodies and destroy legitimate commands.
    #
    # Notes:
    #   - `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `echo` are allowed to touch ANY path
    #     (including outside the project root). The source of a `cp` is
    #     read-only to the FS, and writing to arbitrary dirs is a legitimate
    #     need (copying from ~/.clacky/skills/..., writing to /tmp, etc.).
    #
    # Raises SecurityError on block. Returns a (possibly rewritten) command
    # string on success.
