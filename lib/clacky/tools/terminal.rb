    # Unified terminal tool — the SINGLE entry point for running shell
    # commands. Replaces the former `shell` + `safe_shell` tools.
    #
    # === AI-facing contract
    #
    # Five call shapes, all on one tool:
    #
    #   1) Run a command, wait for it:
    #        terminal(command: "ls -la")
    #        → { exit_code: 0, output: "..." }
    #
    #   2) Run a command that is expected to keep running (dev servers,
    #      watchers, REPLs meant to stay open):
    #        terminal(command: "rails s", background: true)
    #      – collects ~2s of startup output, then:
    #      – if it crashed in those 2s → { exit_code: N, output: "..." }
    #      – if still alive           → { session_id: 7, state: "background",
    #                                     output: "Puma starting..." }
    #
    #   3) A previous call returned a session_id because the command
    #      blocked on input (sudo password, REPL, etc.). Answer it:
    #        terminal(session_id: 3, input: "mypass\n")
    #
    #   4) Poll a running session for new output without sending anything:
    #        terminal(session_id: 7, input: "")
    #
    #   5) Kill a stuck / no-longer-wanted session:
    #        terminal(session_id: 7, kill: true)
    #
    # === Response handshake
    #
    #   - Response has `exit_code` → command finished.
    #   - Response has `session_id` → command is still running;
    #     look at `state`: "waiting" means blocked on input,
    #     "background" means intentionally long-running.
    #
    # === Safety
    #
    # Every new `command` is routed through Clacky::Tools::Security before
    # being handed to the shell. This:
    #   - Blocks sudo / pkill clacky / eval / curl|bash / etc.
    #   - Rewrites `curl ... | bash` into "download & review".
    #   - Protects Gemfile / .env / .ssh / etc. from writes.
    # `rm` is additionally intercepted at runtime by a shell function
    # installed in each PTY session (see SAFE_RM_BASH): it moves files
    # into the per-project trash at $CLACKY_TRASH_DIR instead of
    # deleting them. See trash_manager for list/restore.
    # `input` is NOT subject to these rules (it is a reply to an already-
    # running program, not a fresh command).
    class Terminal < Base
      self.tool_name = "terminal"
      self.tool_description = <<~DESC.strip
        Run shell commands via PTY. Safety: rm→trash, sudo blocked, secrets protected.

        Shapes:
          {command}                       run + wait
          {command, background:true}      long-running; returns session_id after ~2s if alive
          {session_id, input:"pw\n"}      reply to prompt / poll (input:"")
          {session_id, kill:true}         stop

        Single-line only. For multi-line scripts (heredoc, loops, multi-statement blocks)
        write a file first, then run it: write(path:"/tmp/run.sh", content:...) → terminal(command:"bash /tmp/run.sh").

        Response: exit_code = done; session_id = running (state: waiting/background/timeout).
        If output exceeds the limit, `output` is truncated and `full_output_file` points
        at a file on disk — use terminal(command: "grep ... <path>") to search it.
        input supports byte escapes: \x03 Ctrl-C, \x04 Ctrl-D, \t Tab, \x1b Esc.

      #   multi-line commands, globs, and variable expansion are all

      #                 multi-line, heredoc, glob, env-var expansion).

      #                 child scripts. Same coverage as the old rewriter.

      #      echo). Same shape as (1) or (2) but not anchored to the start.
