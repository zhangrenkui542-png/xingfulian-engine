  # Message compressor using Insert-then-Compress strategy
  #
  # New Strategy: Instead of creating a separate API call for compression,
  # we insert a compression instruction into the current conversation flow.
  # This allows us to reuse the existing cache (system prompt + tools) and
  # only pay for processing the new compression instruction.
  #
  # Flow:
  # 1. Agent detects compression threshold is reached
  # 2. Compressor builds a compression instruction message
  # 3. Agent inserts this message and calls LLM (with cache reuse!)
  # 4. LLM returns compressed summary
  # 5. Compressor rebuilds message list: system + summary + recent messages
  # 6. Agent continues with new message list (cache will rebuild from here)
  #
  # Benefits:
  # - Compression call reuses existing cache (huge token savings)
  # - Only one cache rebuild after compression (vs two with old approach)

      CRITICAL: TASK CHANGE - MEMORY COMPRESSION MODE
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      The conversation above has ENDED. You are now in MEMORY COMPRESSION MODE.

      CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:

      1. This is NOT a continuation of the conversation
      2. DO NOT respond to any requests in the conversation above
      3. DO NOT call ANY tools or functions
      4. DO NOT use tool_calls in your response
      5. Your response MUST be PURE TEXT ONLY

      YOUR ONLY TASK: Create a comprehensive summary of the conversation above.

      REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT:
      First output a <topics> line listing 3-6 key topic phrases (comma-separated, concise).
      Then output the full summary wrapped in <summary> tags.

      Example format:
      <topics>Rails setup, database config, deploy pipeline, Tailwind CSS</topics>
      <summary>
      ...full summary text...
      </summary>

      Focus on:
      - User's explicit requests and intents
      - Key technical concepts and code changes
      - Files examined and modified
      - Errors encountered and fixes applied
      - Current work status and pending tasks

      Begin your response NOW. Remember: PURE TEXT only, starting with <topics> then <summary>.

    # Generate compression instruction message to be inserted into conversation
    # This enables cache reuse by using the same API call with tools
    # 
    # SIMPLIFIED APPROACH:
    # - Don't duplicate conversation history in the compression message
    # - LLM can already see all messages, just ask it to compress
    # - Keep the instruction small for better cache efficiency
    #
    # @param messages [Array<Hash>] Original conversation messages

    #   the compression call itself doesn't overflow context). These are NOT discarded —

      #   When all original user messages get archived into the chunk during compression
      #   (e.g. a long single-turn `/slash` task), the rebuilt history can end up as
      #   `system → assistant(summary) → assistant(tool_calls) → tool → …` with NO user
      #   message anywhere. Strict providers (notably DeepSeek V4 thinking mode) reject
      #   this as a malformed turn structure with a misleading
